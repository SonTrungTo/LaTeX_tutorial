  I am writing this letter to express my interest in joining the Finance Business
  Trainee Program offered by Fazer Oy, and I believe I have the qualifications for
  the job.

  I have training in Econometrics and Statistical Analysis. The first one taught
  me how to use Stata (I learnt R by myself), and the second one taught me how to use
  Excel. I am also well-versed in mathematical economics, having passed
  the Mathematical Methods for Economists with $5$-grade. Addtionally, even with
  just my B.Sc, I have already passed a doctoral course in Microeconomics with $3$
  while doing full-time job as a dishwasher, and I was praised as "exceptional"
  by Pauli Murto, the head of Department of Economics at Aalto because the course
  is very challenging, and there are Ph.D candidates who fail that course. Lastly,
  I have strong teamwork experience in the minor, having worked with teammates
  and understood that an understanding and upbeat attitude are needed in dealing
  with people. So I am compassionate and willing to help people coming from a weaker
  background because everyone is different.

  So due to these details, I am confident that I will be a valuable, diversified
  part of the team and make Fazer Business becomes a better place.
