  I am writing this letter to express my interest in joining
  Dream Broker Fullstack Developer.

  I have had background in programming ever since 2016, with my
  first language being the C Programming Language by K \& R. Starting
  from that, and thanks to the Coronavirus, I have had the chance
  to seriously study and make my first steps in being a
  one of the best FullStack Developers you can find in Finland.
  As you can see from my portfolio, I am very well on my way to become
  a better developer. As I am trying to become a more fluent developer on Kubernetes,
  I hope you will give me a chance to grow more as a developer,
  such as skills in working with teammates, communicating with and helping other
  people to succeed!

  Keywords: MERN, TypeScript, Docker, JavaScript, React-Native, Jest

  So due to these details, I am confident that I will be a valuable, diversified
  part of the team and make Dream Broker becomes a better place.
