    \item\label{1.a} $a=3$, $b=5$ $\Rightarrow$ $x=2^5-1=31$, $y=1+2^5+2^{10}=1057$
    \item Since $32,767$ is not a prime, $2^{32,767} - 1$ is not a prime either.
    Therefore, there exists a positive integer $0<x<2^{32,767}-1$ such that
    $2^{32,767}-1$ is divisible by $x$. Hence, by \ref{1.a}, $x=2^{31}-1$ satisfies this.
  \end{enumerate}

    $3^n-1$ is even for all $n$.
  \end{ab}
  \begin{ab}
    If $n$ is prime, $3^n-2^n$ is prime.
  \end{ab}
  \begin{ab}
    If $n$ is not prime, $3^n-2^n$ is not prime.

  We have the following theorem.
  \begin{thm}[Theorem 3]
    There are infinitely many prime numbers.
  \end{thm}
  Its proof gives a method of finding a prime number $n$ different from the ones in a given list.
  However, one needs to be careful of prime numbers \emph{not} in the list
  and smaller than $n$, since the proof assumes that primes are finite. Example,
  $n=3\cdot5+1=15+1=16$ is not a prime number. Hence,
  \begin{cd}[Method]
    To find a prime different from the list, check if it is divisible by other primes
    missing from the list.
  \end{cd}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Let $n=2\cdot5+1=11$. $n$ is not divisible by $3,7$, a new prime number.
    \item Let $n=2\cdot3+1=7$. $n$ is not divisible by $5,11$, a new prime number.
  \end{enumerate}

    $3,5,7$ is the unique triplet prime.

  I do not know now to prove it.
