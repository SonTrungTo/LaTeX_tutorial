  % Example 1
  \ldots when Einstein introduced his formula
  \begin{equation}
    e = m \cdot c^2 \; ,
  \end{equation}
  which is the same time the most widely known
  and the least well understood physical formula.

  % Example 2
  \ldots from which follows Kirchhoff's current law:
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \; .
  \end{equation}

  Kirchhoff's voltage law can be derived \ldots

  % Example 3
  \ldots which has several advantages.

  \begin{equation}
    I_D = I_F - I_R
  \end{equation}
  is the core of a very different transitor model. \ldots  I think this is:
